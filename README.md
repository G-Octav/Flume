### Flume

Flume is an extensible and simple to use level editor for 2D top-down games, it's the main level editor used in Council of Torment.

  - Create powerful 2D maps, and see them the way they will be in the game
  - Export them under **lua**, a powerful scripting language that's really easy to parse and really fast!
  - Make it yours - add your own features to it by forking the repository and then programming your own features to it.
  - Works for any size, and tileset, right out of the box.
